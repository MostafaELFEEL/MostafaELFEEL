# üí´ About Me:
I am a graduate who studied in the interdisciplinary program at Faculty of Engineering at Ain Shams University. My major is Mechatronics Engineering, and I am proud to say that I was one of the top 10 students in my major colleges. With a current excellent grade and a GPA of 3.38, I am a hardworking individual who strives for excellence in all aspects of my life. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a passionate soccer player, with my position being goalkeeper. I also love going to the gym to stay in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle. When I'm not on the field or studying, I enjoy relaxing with some anime and listening to music. I am currently on the lookout for a scholarship opportunity for my Masters degree, and I am excited to see where my education and interests will take me in the future. Thank you for stopping by my profile, and I hope to collaborate with you on future projects!
